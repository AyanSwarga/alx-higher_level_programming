#### Python - Classes and Objects

### What is a Class and Objects in Python?
Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that binds the data members and methods into a single unit. Class is a blueprint or code template for object creation. Using a class, you can create as many objects as you want.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of attributes (variables) and methods. We use the object of a class to perform actions.
Objects have two characteristics: They have states and behaviors (object has attributes and methods attached to it) Attributes represent its state, and methods represent its behavior. Using its methods, we can modify its state.

In short, Every object has the following property.

Identity: Every object must be uniquely identified.
State: An object has an attribute that represents a state of an object, and it also reflects the property of an object.
Behavior: An object has methods that represent its behavior.
Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language, so everything in Python is treated as an object. An object is a real-life entity. It is the collection of various data and functions that operate on those data.

For example, If we design a class based on the states and behaviors of a Person, then States can be represented as instance variables and behaviors as class methods.
## Background Context
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

## Resources
# Read or watch:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
Object-Oriented Programming (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
Properties vs. Getters and Setters
